Responses to Project Euler problems

Particularly proud of the third (3-prime.js), as it manages to find a solution quickly, rather than using brute force.

Note: I've been solving Project Euler problems as part of HackerRank's Project Euler+ contest. My answers for those are in [this repo](https://github.com/ubershibs/hackerrank/tree/master/projecteuler), including many more than are found here.
